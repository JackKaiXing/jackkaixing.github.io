            <p >
                Lambert BRDF is just one kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function">BRDF</a>,
                that used to decribe how light reflect in the Lambert way. We use it because we assume the property of material belongs to this Lambert way, i.e."ideal matte".
                Like many other concepts in Computer Graphics field, this is contribution of both thoery assumption and experimental observation.<br/><br/>
                The other question is about how to derive the mathmatical expression of Lambert BRDF. Here is two result, <a href="https://sakibsaikia.github.io/graphics/2019/09/10/Deriving-Lambertian-BRDF-From-First-Principles.html">Deriving Lambertian BRDF from first principles</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-shading/diffuse-lambertian-shading">Diffuse or Lambertian Shading</a>. 
                Compared with those two, what confused me is about the definition of albedo, defined as " the ratio of reflected radiation from a surface to the amount of radiation that hits it" without
                mentioning "directions". In <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/">Real-Time-Renderig-4th</a>, it mentions "directional-hemispherical reflectance" also "hemispherical-directional reflectance", which I believe the former is the albedo.
                <span class="math display">\[\rho =\int_{\Omega}f_r(x,\omega_i,\omega_o)  (\omega_o . n) d\omega_o \]</span>
                The <span class="math display">\[f_r(x,\omega_i,\omega_o)\]</span> is constant for lambert reflection for any viewing angle and could be moved out of integration. Then rest of the derivation follows as mentioned before.<br/><br/>
                Note: If the BRDF is reciprocal, then the hemispherical-directional reflectance and the directional-hemispherical reflectance are equal and the same function can be used to compute either one.
