                Choosing a BRDF is to decide what you want to present. It is kind of a question of your Product Design. 
                First of all, there is no absolutely accurate physical shading, even through there are engines teams claim so, while the equation of the under BRDF differs from each other.
                Second, rendering is not just a technical work but involving art work, and remember that physical is not equal to beautiful or pleasing.</p><br/>

                I looked into some engines, experienced their user functions and concludes as follows.
                
                <table border="1", align="center">
                    <tr>
                        <td>Engine Name</td>
                        <td>Why</td>
                        <td>How</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Blender:Workbench</td>
                        <td>Super Fast and a clear view for scene structure visualization, i.e. modeling/transforming</td>
                        <td>G_Buffer for performance, Blinn-Phong and Wrap Shading for appearance, Studio Lights for a clear view of different objects/mehsParts</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Disney BRDF Explorer</td>
                        <td>A uniform model and a uniform set of paramters to be capable to capture lots of effects and artistic pleasing</td>
                        <td>This is more computation intense, usually coupled with a fully physical rendering pipeline(lighting/shadowing/IBL/Some other screen sapce effect) and using only this makes non-sense. It expects its output to be product level.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Luxcore</td>
                        <td>Why</td>
                        <td>How</td>
                    </tr>
